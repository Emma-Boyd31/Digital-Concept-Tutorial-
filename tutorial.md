## Safe Password Creation Steps

1. The first step in creating a safe password is to make sure it isn't being used on any of your previous websites or accounts.

2. Make sure your password is long, the longer the better, but aim for around 12. The safest passwords are usually around 14 characters long.

3. Don't use common phrases or words, also stay away from using personal information such as your name, relatives' names, birthdays, pet names, or anything that someone could guess.

4. Do not use numbers or letters in order, such as abc or 123.

5. Use a mix of letters, capitalization, numbers, and characters when creating your password.

6. Stay away from words that are found in the dictionary, and even replace words in the dictionary with numbers and characters. For example, don't use the number 0 in replacement as the letter O.

7. Use random organization when creating your password, mix all types of allowed characters together.
   
8. Change passwords regularly to keep accounts secure and make sure passwords aren't compromised.
